		<description><![CDATA[A fascinating discussion is definitely worth comment.

I believe that you should publish more on this subject matter, it might not be a taboo matter 
but typically people don&#039;t talk about such subjects.
To the next! All the best!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My son&#039;s school has gone through a terrible trauma, which because of red tape and the machinations of the coirt, has not come to an end after nearly two years. A parent whose child has been affected first hand by the criminal actions of a hostel master has taken it upon herself to investigate any further abuse. I think her trauma and pain must be unbearable and I do not want to discount this on anyway. I feel however this has become so all consuming for her she lacks objectivity and had turned her lack of control over the situation into a repeated and incessant witch hunt and villification of the school and all the people in it. This obviously has a knock on affect and is now negatively affecting all the staff and the children. How do you stop this. She repeatedly posts negative reports or posts about the school that can only be liked or shared through Facebook. She continuously feeds the press an industry which she comes from skewed and negative reports about the school. If the school was an individual, this would be clear harrassment and abuse. So difficult because she is so deeply wounded by what happened to her boy.]]></description>
