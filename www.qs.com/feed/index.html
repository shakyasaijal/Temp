						<div class="fusion-text"><p><strong>QS welcomes the <a href="http://www.exeduk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/APPG-Report-FINAL-WEB-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> published this month by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for International Students.</strong> <strong>The report, which cites findings from <a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/qs_international_student_survey_2018/?utm_source=qs&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QS&#8217; International Student Survey</a>, sets out a blueprint for the sustainable growth of UK international education.</strong></p>
<p>Establishing an ambitious cross-departmental strategy for international student recruitment will help ensure the higher education sector remains one of the UK’s greatest exports.</p>
<p>Growth will only be possible if the UK’s immigration system encourages international students to choose the UK. The report’s recommendation that the Government should offer a clearly labelled and attractive post-study work visa which allows up to two years of work experience in the UK is welcome. As our findings from <a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/qs_international_student_survey_2018/?utm_source=qs&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QS’ International Student Survey 2018</a> &#8211; cited in the report &#8211; show, 40% of prospective international students considering the UK stated that one of their top five considerations when selecting a study destination was the ability to get a visa after graduating.</p>
<p>Additionally, strategies for growth will only find success if the UK has a welcoming perception. We support the APPG for International Students&#8217; recommendation that messages for international students regarding the UK should be welcoming, clear, simple and consistent, and developed in cooperation between Government and the sector. As our research highlights in the report, campaigns such as the #WeAreInternational and #LondonIsOpen have a positive impact, with 82% of prospective international students saying the campaigns have positively influenced their perceptions of the UK. Sending a clear message that international students are welcome in the UK is essential in sustaining the UK’s position in an increasingly competitive international market.</p>
<p>In this uncertain time for higher education, we are pleased to see our research and insights continue to inform both the HE sector and Government. Earlier this year, our insights were cited in the <a href="https://www.policyconnect.org.uk/hec/sites/site_hec/files/report/469/fieldreportdownload/hecreport09-18final.pdf?utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HE Commission’s report</a> on higher education exports. And last year we submitted written evidence to the Education Select Committee’s inquiry into the impact of exiting the EU on higher education, which was subsequently included in the <a href="http://www.qs-enrolmentsolutions.com/qs-enrolment-solutions-research-cited-in-house-of-commons-briefing-paper-on-international-and-eu-students-uk-emea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>.</p>
<p>Listening to prospective students by recognising and responding to their differing needs is vital if we are serious about developing a successful cross-departmental strategy in this key policy area post-Brexit. At QS we will continue to play our role by providing key insight and analysis at this crucial time for the sector.</p>
<p>QS’ 2019 International Student Survey is due to be published in Spring. To receive the 2018 <a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/qs_international_student_survey_2018/?utm_source=qs&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Student Survey</a> report, visit <u><a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/qs_international_student_survey_2018/?utm_source=qs&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.internationalstudentsurvey.com</a></u> and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/qs_corporate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@QS_corporate</a> on Twitter to stay up to date.</p>

						<div class="fusion-text"><p><strong>QS Quacquarelli Symonds have released the World University Rankings Latin America 2019. This year, 63 Mexican institutions were ranked, second only to Brazil (91) in terms of total number of institution&#8217;s represented in the rankings. </strong></p>
<p>Out of these 63 universities, 28 are in the top 200 and seven in the top 50. Universidad del Valle de Atemajac and CETYS Universidad are the two new entrants.</p>
<p>The indicators which Mexican institutions show a more competitive performance against their regional peers are Academic Reputation and Faculty Student Ratio. Academic Reputation reflects how reputable the university is amongst academics from other institutions. 15 Mexican Universities occupy the top 100 in this indicator. Faculty Student Ratio, which measures the quality of teaching, presented an average score of 38.3 among the top 100, outperforming the Brazilian national average of 23.8.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em>Papers per Faculty</em> and <em>Staff with PhD</em> are the main indicators responsible for bringing down the performance of Mexican institutions. <em>Papers Per Faculty &#8211; </em>which<em> </em>measures the capacity of an institution to communicate their knowledge production to the scientific community – is a reason for concern, having only one Mexican institution featuring in the top 50.</p>
</div><span class="fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-1 hover-type-none"><img src="http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-31_16h04_06.png" width="753" height="531" alt="" title="2018-10-31_16h04_06" class="img-responsive wp-image-299032" srcset="http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-31_16h04_06-200x141.png 200w, http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-31_16h04_06-400x282.png 400w, http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-31_16h04_06-600x423.png 600w, http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-31_16h04_06.png 753w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 753px" /></span><div class="fusion-text"><p><em>Faculty Staff with PhD</em> is the indicator that measures the proportion of academic faculty staff that have been awarded a PhD. Although there is a 7.5% improvement in the average scores of Faculty Staff with PhD in relation to last year, the national average is still -14.5% behind the regional average. These numbers suggest that Mexican universities are not able to follow the pace of investment in developing academic staff when compared to other Latin American countries. A greater proportion of Faculty Staff with PhD is likely to favor the enhancement of research activity and production of papers.</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenge faced by Mexican universities is to maintain the quality provided from a teaching focused approach while generating conditions so that the knowledge taught in classrooms is formalized and shared with the global scientific community.</p>

						<div class="fusion-text"><p><strong>This year, <a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/2019-qs-world-university-rankings-brics-supplement/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">QS Regional Rankings: BRICS</a> results indicate that Brazilian universities are failing to keep pace with their competitors, with more than 60% of the 90 ranked Brazilian universities falling year-on-year: a trend that compounds a decreasing presence in the top 50 over the last five years. </strong></p>
<p>Back in 2015, Brazil had nine institutions among the top 50 &#8211; only five remain in the 2019 edition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, only two Brazilian universities feature in the top 20, fewer than not only China – which dominates the ranking – but also India and Russia. Both of these Brazilian top-20 entrants have fallen: the Universidade de Sao Paulo has dropped from 13th to 14th, while Unicamp has regressed even more sharply, sliding from 12th to 16th.</p>
<p>By examining metric-by-metric data for the top 50 Brazilian institutions in this ranking, it is clear that Brazilian stagnation is primarily attributable to under-performance in two main indicators: citations per paper and international student ratio. Investing in internationalization typically facilitates a strengthening of communication channels with other countries. The refinement of this dialogue can positively influence how the country&#8217;s research is produced and perceived by the international community, increasing its visibility and chances of being cited.</p>

Concomitantly, in August of this year, the president of one of the most important agencies for higher education funding in Brazil – CAPES &#8211; wrote a <a href="https://sei.capes.gov.br/sei/controlador_externo.php?acao=documento_conferir&amp;codigo_verificador=0746852&amp;codigo_crc=6755A444&amp;hash_download=ef5e65b749e9b6a0c124c56e438345f0dbb86d4b097fccd29f4b4221365642ee971b5a5e507aea925d83d67d1d4d79f08696fa5be30b507aa19122ff68c396a9&amp;visualizacao=1&amp;id_orgao_acesso_externo=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warning letter</a> to the Minister of Education announcing that, in light of the current restrictive budget, the institution would need to cancel the funding of 93,000 graduate students and 150,000 recipients of training programs.</p>
<p>As though to underline Brazil’s educational struggles, the 200-year-old National Museum, part of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), suffered <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45392668" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a fire that provoked the destruction</a> of most of its collection, representing an irreversible social and academic loss.</p>
<p>Bench-marking institutions and national higher education systems against their peers is a central purpose of this analysis, and the 2019 edition of QS BRICS ranking indicates Brazil is not matching the accelerating pace of other nations in this exercise. Those results are not necessarily surprising, since they are caused by, and expressive of, economic, political and social challenges the country is facing.</p>

<p><strong>Global overview of core skills: importance versus satisfaction </strong></p>
</div><span class="fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-3 hover-type-none"><img src="http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-29_11h21_32.png" width="714" height="757" alt="" title="2018-10-29_11h21_32" class="img-responsive wp-image-298980" srcset="http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-29_11h21_32-200x212.png 200w, http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-29_11h21_32-400x424.png 400w, http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-29_11h21_32-600x636.png 600w, http://www.qs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-10-29_11h21_32.png 714w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 714px" /></span><div class="fusion-text"><p>Why might resilience be the most sought-after competency in today&#8217;s global labor market, and what aspects might be influencing this result?</p>
<p>Resilience is the capacity of an individual to overcome difficult experiences throughout their lives. It is the ability to adapt to challenging situations. As defined by the Oxford dictionary, resilience is “the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness.”</p>
<p>This concept has been broadly studied in the field of psychology and can be observed when individuals are put in a situation outside of their control where they have to go through a sharp change, either socially, cognitively, or emotionally. Such external demands can lead individuals to either adapt to the situation, which can also be understood as finding a solution to the problem, or to be paralyzed by the event. This paralysis can manifest in both psychological (generating traumas) and physical aspects (increased stress levels and diseases).</p>

<p>This relationship comes through in the <a href="http://bit.ly/2wZr7CT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">QS Global Skills Gap Report</a> findings too, where those three skills demonstrate the widest gaps, as measured by the difference between the importance placed on a skill and the resulting satisfaction with it:</p>

<p>The better challenges are identified and communicated, the higher the possibility of offering a helpful solution. Individuals with a good history of addressing problems are more likely to have high perceived self-efficacy, being better positioned to respond effectively to future challenges, generating a virtuous circle of resilience.</p>

						<div class="fusion-text"><p><strong>Five of China’s C9 universities have reached their highest-ever position in the most recent edition of a prominent international ranking of Asia’s top universities, providing further evidence that China’s leading institutions continue to become more competitive relative to their continental peers.</strong></p>
<p>The 2019 edition of the <em>QS Mainland China University Rankings 2019</em>, released today by London-headquartered think tank QS Quacquarelli Symonds, sees Tsinghua University retain its status as China’s best university, rising from 5<sup>th</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> in Asia. It is joined in the continental top five by Peking University, which equals its highest-ever rank (5<sup>th</sup>).</p>
<p>QS’s rankings are the world’s most-consulted university performance evaluations, with QS’s flagship website, <a href="http://www.TopUniversities.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.TopUniversities.com</a>, having received 50 million visits so far this year. This ranking offers Chinese students independent international insight into the regional – and global &#8211; standing of China’s institutions. 113 Chinese universities are ranked – over 20% of the 500 Asian institutions that will feature in the published <em>QS University Rankings: Asia</em>, to be released on October 31<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<h3><strong>Key facts</strong></h3>
<p>• Five of Asia’s top 20 universities are Chinese for the first time – and all five are C9 universities;<br />
• Tsinghua University leads China partly because it has achieved outstanding renown among both academics and employers. It is one of only two universities in China to achieve perfect scores for both QS’s Academic Reputation and Employer Reputation indicators: the other is Peking University;<br />
• Fudan University, which debuted in the top 10 last year, continues to improve, rising from 7th to 6th: a fifth consecutive year of improvement;<br />
• Zhejiang University enters the top 20 for the first time, rising from 21st to 13th;<br />
• Shanghai Jiao Tong University also enjoys its first-ever year among Asia’s top 20 universities, improving from 22nd to 19th;<br />
• Progress for China’s Double First Class universities is more modest, but the overall results are still positive. Of the 36 Double First Class Universities to receive an ‘A’ classification, 19 have improved their rank. 3 remain stable, and 4 drop.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Sowter</strong>, Research Director at QS, said: “The rise of Chinese universities has been one of the major narratives we’ve observed since we started compiling rankings fifteen years ago, with targeted government investment and a desire to prioritise research excellence key factors in the sector’s increasing prominence.&#8221;</p>

						<div class="fusion-text"><p><strong>The number of students choosing to study overseas has grown exponentially over the past two decades, where those international students make a vital contribution to the higher education sector and the wider economy of their destination countries. </strong></p>
<p>If we are to sustain and grow the number of international students travelling across the globe in pursuit of learning, then immigration systems are an important consideration.</p>
<p>Many countries across the globe have post-study work systems that recognize the value of international students and see the benefits of these students staying in their local communities after completion of their studies. They understand that these students can use their skills and expert knowledge they have developed in jobs that benefit local communities and boost productivity for all.</p>
<h3><strong>What do international students think about post-study work visas?</strong></h3>
<p>As our annual <a href="https://www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/international-student-survey-2018/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Student Survey</a> (ISS) has shown for many years, immigration systems are a key factor in international student decision-making, impacting where students choose to study. Our <a href="https://www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/international-student-survey-2018/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest ISS</a> found that over 40% of international students identify whether they can get a visa to work after graduating in their top five things that are most important when choosing a country to study in.</p>
<p>There are many international students that would love the opportunity to work in their host country post-study. 41% of international students expect to stay in the country they studied in for six months or more (e.g. on a post-study work visa or for further study) and then return home. Meanwhile, 15% plan to stay in the country they chose to study in permanently.</p>
<h3><strong>How do post-study work visas affect international student recruitment across the world?</strong></h3>
<p>Yet, there are differences across the world in the way countries look to promote and encourage post-study work. Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the USA (though President Trump’s immigration policies for post-study work may become more restrictive),  have no minimum salary thresholds and are flexible for recent graduates who are searching for a job. The UK, however, is one of the only English-speaking nations not to have a specific post-study work visa. Instead, students have four months at the end of their student visa to find a job with a general Tier 2 sponsor.</p>
<p>Post-study rights more broadly, however, may soon change in the UK. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) – an independent body that advises the UK government – recently recommended that PhD students automatically be given one year’s leave to remain after completion of studies, that the current MSc pilot should be extended so all these students have six months, and that the window of opportunity to apply for a Tier 2 visa be widened for students finishing their undergraduate studies.</p>
<p>It is pertinent, then, that our <a href="https://www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/international-student-survey-2018/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey this year</a> found that those interested in studying in the UK are much less likely to want to stay (either on a post-study work visa or permanently) than those interested in studying in Australia or the United States. For example, we found for those interested in studying in the UK, 30% said they expect to stay in the country they studied in for six months or more before eventually returning home, whereas 40% and 39% of those interested in Australia and the US respectively said the same. Though more research is needed, a tentative conclusion can be drawn from this &#8211; making it easier for international students to transition from university to gaining post-study-rights can impact student recruitment positively.</p>
<p>As ever, QS Enrolment Solutions stands ready to listen to prospective students and help the HE sectors across the world to recognize and respond to their differing needs.</p>

						<div class="fusion-text"><p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Universities that place highly in global rankings are an incentive to pay higher fees, according to new research with international students in Australia. </span></strong></p>
<p>The analysis, led by an education consultancy in New South Wales, revealed the value of university reputation among applicants and their parents, who are willing to pay extra for the quality and brand of a highly ranked institution.</p>
<p>On average, there is a substantial monetary difference between higher and lower-ranked universities in Australia, with the latter charging an average annual fee of AUD25,000 and the former reaching up to AUD40,0000.</p>
<p>The study acknowledges the correlation between performance in the <a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/2019-qs-world-university-rankings-top-500/?utm_source=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QS World University Rankings (QSWUR)</a> and fees for international students, suggesting that this trend is projected to continue: <em>“We can see that the relationship (between ranking and fee levels) is getting stronger and stronger.” </em></p>
<p>Having realized this relationship between performance in the <a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/2019-qs-world-university-rankings-top-500/?utm_source=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QSWUR</a> and student fees, a similar trend had been established in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. The study authors claim to favor QS as it encompasses a larger body of universities globally.</p>
<p>The impact of rankings on fees is twofold: universities feel encouraged to set higher fees and international students are less reluctant to pay them. According to the study authors, this isn’t how fee structures in Australia were decided in the past, demonstrating the transformational effect rankings have had on the higher education (HE) sector.</p>
<p>The growing reputation of Australia as a study destination is likely to play key a role in the findings. In the 2019 edition of the <a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/2019-qs-world-university-rankings-top-500/?utm_source=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QSWUR</a>, 25 Australian institutions placed within the top 100. Moreover, current research at QS, including the 2018 report <a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/2018-qs-applicant-survey-what-drives-an-international-student-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘What Drives an International Student Today?’</a>, highlights the growing popularity of Australia among international students &#8211; especially those affected by political events in the US and the UK.</p>
<p>The report reveals that Canada and Australia are emerging as alternative English-speaking study destinations, following policy changes triggered by the US election of President Trump and Britain’s decision to exit the EU. There have even been reports of Australia having overtaken the UK to become the second most popular study destination (behind the US) for international students.</p>
<p>However, this relationship between fees and rankings is not replicated in nearby HE markets, such as New Zealand, where only the University of Auckland uses their performance in the rankings as a justification for higher international fees.</p>
<p>This also raises questions about barriers to quality education in Australia – if students from less economically wealthy backgrounds are faced with rising fees from the top-ranked universities, will they be dissuaded from studying there?</p>

						<div class="fusion-text"><p><strong>Communication is the cornerstone of civilization, separating humans from other species. Without the ability to express, people cannot convey their basic needs or deepest desires. Dreams can never be uttered and therefore can never become reality.</strong></p>
<p>Certainly, no one can lead a squad into victory without solid communication skills. Yet, top business schools still struggle to find the best ways to teach this vital tool. This has consequences.</p>
<p>Recruiters are demanding more from the MBAs business schools produce. In the <a href="https://www.topmba.com/why-mba/publications/jobs-salary-trends-report-2018" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jobs and Salary Trends Report 2018</a>, we learned that many employers feel new MBA hires need more soft skills. Specifically, the interpersonal relationship and leadership skills, which include communication, were lacking compared to the importance employers placed upon them.</p>
<p>“The message for MBAs is clear: employers are looking for visionaries, not just functional managers who are able to keep things ticking along,” according to the report. Obviously, communication plays an important role in being a “visionary” because you have to articulate what you envision for the future.</p>
<p>That’s why business schools have to make improving communication skills among students a priority. Learn why this is the right path at institutions of higher learning in general and particularly at MBA programs.</p>
<h3><strong>To dole out assignments</strong></h3>
<p>Most importantly, leaders must delegate. This requires explanation of your expectations. You have to be able to tell each individual what is his or her responsibility. In addition, you have to explicitly convey the tasks at hand and exactly how to execute them.</p>
<p>A leader communicates to all the cogs in the wheel, so they know how they fit and what part they will be playing in getting the thing to roll. You have to dream in color and describe that vision in simple black and white. The point is your people must understand how they fit into the big picture. It’s your job to tell them.</p>
<h3><strong>To lift spirits</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in creating a cohesive team is having everyone know his or her role in accomplishing certain goals. The next step is keeping everyone motivated, so together you eventually achieve success. Learning how to provide directions, so employees can take them and run is easy when compared to offering an uplifting message. In other words, ordering people around is not enough to be a good manager. You have to inspire them and keep them invested in bringing your vision to fruition.</p>
<p>This is where communication becomes less technical and more artful. In essence, this is the hard part. And this is indeed where many teachers lose business students. They get numbers and logic and putting together words, so the team knows its chores, but communicating emotion to motivate people is far more complicated.</p>
<p>Still, there are tricks to the trade. Professors can share examples of poignant speakers, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. They can teach you to ask questions about employees’ feelings. Then, you can respond appropriately with your well-chosen words (which is also teachable).</p>
<p>Finally, you can learn how to tap into any natural talents you might have for relating to others. To lift spirits, words alone won’t cut it. You have to prove you genuinely care about the people with whom you’re working. Employees must feel they matter to you and that their work has value.</p>
<h3><strong>To learn, to listen</strong></h3>
<p>What people fail to realize is that more than half of proper communication requires being a good listener. In fact, relationship experts will tell you that learning to listen is vital to everything from being a successful teacher to keeping your marriage together.</p>
<p>Some therapists actually have people practice their listening skills. For example, they might have one person listen to the other and repeat word for word what he or she said. Often, they don’t get it right the first time around. You have to develop the skill of truly hearing what another says. This kind of training would be useful to business leaders and members of a team alike.</p>
<p>Once you actually hear another person, you can begin to take his or her ideas and opinions into account. You can hash out any differences you have. Perhaps, best of all, you can put yourself in his or her shoes and get a sense of the experience of another.</p>
<h3><strong>To make sales</strong></h3>
<p>Good communication skills usually translate into a better bottom line. After all, if you and your employees have the capacity to describe the product or service you’re selling and explain its worth to others, then you can convince them to buy it.</p>
<p>Converting sales also requires relationship building and relationships are built on communication. As your ability to communicate improves, so will your network, which will lead to more partnerships and sales. With the right people on your side, frankly, the possibilities are virtually endless.</p>
<h3><strong>To better handle crises</strong></h3>
<p>Many businesses suffer a crisis every now and then. The difference between surviving or dying during one is how you handle it. Good communication can help your business stay alive as you can act swiftly to share the appropriate words explaining the crisis both internally and to the public. You can also adeptly answer questions from journalists, government officials, consumers, and others.</p>
<p>Just imagine how much better things might be going for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during the ongoing Facebook-Cambridge Analytica saga if he had better communication skills.</p>
<h3><strong>To capitalize on charisma</strong></h3>
<p>Great communicators can tell a winning story at a dinner party. Most of all, they can use their ability to communicate to charm others and make friends. Despite the stereotype of hardened, tough-as-nails managers being able to control employees, most experts will tell you that likeability will yield better results.</p>
<p>After all, as the saying goes, “You catch more bees with honey”. Thus, to better network, keep employees on your team, and reach the top, you need the best communication skills possible.</p>

						<div class="fusion-text"><p>International students are an invaluable asset to the UK’s higher education sector. At QS, we welcome research that gives the sector insight into how we can remain a competitive and desirable place for international students post-Brexit. With international students high on the political agenda, we must continue to provide the research needed to shape policies that ensure the UK is perceived as an attractive and welcoming place for international students to study.</p>
<p>We were delighted to be asked to provide oral evidence earlier this year on our findings and recommendations for the Higher Education Commission’s inquiry into Higher Education Exports. Through our annual <a href="https://www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/international-student-survey-2018/?utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Student Survey (ISS)</a>, we have surveyed over 67,000 prospective international students and have gathered extensive insight into their interests, behaviours and decision-making.</p>
<p>The HE Commission’s recently published report – <a href="https://www.policyconnect.org.uk/hec/research/report-staying-ahead-are-international-students-going-down-under" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Staying Ahead &#8211; Are International Students Going Down Under?</a> &#8211; cites many of our insights. The inquiry – the sixth from the Commission – sought to explore the obstacles to growing HE exports, what can be done to improve the value of exports post-Brexit and how the UK can advance the other benefits of international education exports. Paul Raybould &#8211; Director of B2B Marketing &amp; Market Intelligence &#8211; spoke at the session on international student demand and supply, which was the first of six evidence sessions in the current inquiry.</p>
<p>The Commission’s report cites many of our findings on the impact of Brexit on international student recruitment. For example, outside the EU levels of pessimism are low, with only 10% of prospective students put off from studying in the UK, whereas 39% of prospective EU students said they are less likely to study in the UK as a result of Brexit. This finding is particularly relevant given that the UK’s market position relies quite significantly on numbers arriving from the EU.</p>
<p>In his oral evidence cited by the Commission, Paul Raybould highlighted the importance to prospective international students of a welcoming environment. He noted the positive impact of campaigns such as #WeAreInternational and #LondonIsOpen, with 78% of prospective international students surveyed saying that these campaigns positively influenced their perceptions of the UK as a welcoming destination. This number subsequently increased to 82% in the <a href="https://www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/international-student-survey-2018/?utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 International Student Survey</a>.</p>
<p>We strongly welcome the Commission’s recommendation that the Home Office should establish a ‘friendly environment’ policy for international students with improved post-study work options and a streamlined visa process. We believe this recommendation will help to send a welcoming message from the UK to prospective international students.</p>
<p>In this uncertain time for higher education, we are pleased to see our research and insights continue to inform both the HE sector and Government. Last year, <a href="http://www.qs-enrolmentsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QS Enrolment Solutions</a> submitted written evidence to the <a href="http://www.qs-enrolmentsolutions.com/qs-enrolment-solutions-research-cited-in-house-of-commons-briefing-paper-on-international-and-eu-students-uk-emea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education Select Committee’s inquiry</a> into the impact of exiting the EU on higher education, which was subsequently included in the report.</p>
<p>By harnessing the power of data and taking a more strategic approach to international student recruitment, we at QS believe that universities can achieve success and maintain the UK’s global leadership in higher education. For more insights, download this year’s <a href="https://www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/international-student-survey-2018/?utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Student Survey</a> at <a href="https://www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/international-student-survey-2018/?utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_medium=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/2018</a>.</p>

						<div class="fusion-text"><p><strong>Newly published research by QS and the ISE (Institute of Student Employers) explores one of the most pressing issues facing higher education today.</strong></p>
<p>The 2018 QS report titled, ‘<a href="http://www.qs.com/portfolio-items/the-global-skills-gap-in-the-21st-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Global Graduate Skills Gap in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</a>’ has exposed the skills gap to be a global and significantly widespread issue. Drawing on research conducted annually for the 2018 QS Employer Survey and the 2018 QS Applicant Survey, there appears to be a shortfall in skill attainment across the board, as well as a mismatch in expectations among students and employers.</p>
<p>Such findings may indicate that there is a communication barrier between universities and employers that needs to be addressed in order to bridge the skills gap. For instance, employers were required to give both an importance and a satisfaction score to a list of 15 key employability skills. 13 of the 15 skills identified received a higher importance score from employers than the satisfaction they attributed to the same skill.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 2018 Applicant Survey data suggests that prospective students do not fully understand how employers value skills. Students tend to over-value the importance of creativity and leadership skills and under-value the importance of flexibility/adaptability and teamwork, which employers regard with high importance. It is clear that such discrepancies call for raising awareness, so that students are informed about which skills organizations prioritize before they graduate. It may also indicate that universities are failing to adequately train students in areas that are essential for successful employment.</p>

<p>This view is echoed by Nunzio Quacquarelli, CEO of QS, in his comments about the role universities play in preparing graduates for employment: “<em>It is becoming more and more vital that universities also prepare graduates for the world of work. This means that the development of soft skills, like team-playing and resilience, often becomes as important as the technical skills and knowledge acquired during a degree. Opportunities for internships, study abroad, extra-curricular activity and active learning can all contribute to the development of these and other skills universities want.”</em></p>
<p>Each survey is conducted with thousands of employers and prospective students worldwide, allowing an exploration of divergences among regions within the report. Overall, across the globe, problem solving, the ability to work in a team and communication are considered to be the most important skills by employers.</p>
<p>The most pronounced skills gap has emerged in resilience/dealing with conflict, which ranked as the seventh most important skill, yet achieved a low satisfaction score of just 60.  The American Psychological Association (APA) indicates that a lack of such skill relates to a negative response to conflict or stress, something most graduates are likely to encounter in a new role. However, the APA indicates that this is not a personality trait but rather a behavior that can be learned, thus suggesting that universities and companies should be able to develop the tools to nurture it in students.</p>
<p>There are a number of actions that organizations can adopt in order to bridge the graduate skills gap. Research from the ISE in the UK highlights the efficacy of internships and new training methods and selection processes, which may be beneficial to the employment sectors of other countries. Given the fact that the same issues are replicated among employers worldwide, it seems pertinent that employers begin sharing practices and solutions across the globe in order to effectively confront the international skills gap.</p>
